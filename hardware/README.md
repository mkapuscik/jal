# Hardware

JAL is based on the EZR Happy Gecko family of processors from Silicon Labs.

Current the [EZRHG220 (no USB)](https://www.silabs.com/products/wireless/proprietary/ezr32-happy-gecko-sub-ghz/device.ezr32hg220f32r55g) / [EZRHG320 (USB)](https://www.silabs.com/products/wireless/proprietary/ezr32-happy-gecko-sub-ghz/device.ezr32hg320f32r55g) are being targeted as the processor. Otherwise, an RGB LED, a coin cell, and some assorted supporting passives are the only other parts on the board.
